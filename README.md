<h4 align="center">
  The 21 card trick doesn’t require any kind of sleight of hand, so it’s the perfect trick for beginners to learn. The trick relies on math to work, and it practically performs itself. As the magician, you’ll have your audience volunteer pick any card from a small deck of 21 cards. Through a process of laying out the cards in columns, you’ll be able to maneuver their card into the 11th position in the deck, so you can easily reveal their card.
